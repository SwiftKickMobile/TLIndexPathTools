TLIndexPathTools is a set of components designed to greatly simplify building
rich, dynamic table and collection views. Here are some of the awesome things that TLIndexPathTools does:

* Automatically calculate and perform animated inserts, deletes and moves.
* Automatically organize the data model into sections.
* Simplify implementing data source and delegate methods via rich data model APIs.
* Provide a simpler alternative to Core Data's `NSFetchedResultsController`
* Provide base table view and collection view classes with advanced features
