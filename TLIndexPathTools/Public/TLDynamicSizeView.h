/**
 Table view cells that implement this protocol will have their dynamic heights
 calculated automatically by `TLTableViewController` in its 
 `heightForRow:atIndexPath` implementation.
 
 With Auto Layout, the protocol should only be used as a marker to tell
 `TLTableViewController` to calculate the dynamic height. The `sizeWithData`
 method should not be implemented. In the `TLTableViewController` subclass,
 cell configuration should be one in `tableView:configureCell:atIndexPath:`
 because the `heightForRow:atIndexPath` implementation needs to configure
 a prototype instance before calculating the height. See the Dynamic Height
 example project.
 
 If Auto Layout is not being used, the `sizeWithData` method should be implemented.
