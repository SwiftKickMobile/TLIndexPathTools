/**
 
 `TLIndexPathController` is TLIndexPathTools' version of `NSFetchedResultsController`.
 It should not come as a surprise, then, that you must use this class if you want
 to integrate with Core Data.
 
 Although it primarily exists for Core Data integration, `TLIndexPathController` works
 interchangeably with `NSFetchRequest` or plain 'ol arrays of arbitrary data. Thus,
 if you choose to standardize your view controllers on `TLIndexPathController`,
 it is possible to have a common programming model across all of your table and collection views.
 
 `TLIndexPathController` also makes a few nice improvements relative to `NSFetchedResultsController`:
 
 * Items do not need to be presorted by section. The data model handles organizing sections.
 * Changes to your fetch request are animated. So you can get animated sorting and filtering.
 * There is only one delegate method to implement (versus five for `NSFetchedResultsController`).
 
 The basic template for using `TLIndexPathController` in a (table) view controller is as follows:
 
    #import <UIKit/UIKit.h>
    #import "TLIndexPathController.h"
    @interface ViewController : UITableViewController <TLIndexPathControllerDelegate>
    @end

    #import "ViewController.h"
    @interface ViewController ()
    @property (strong, nonatomic) TLIndexPathController *indexPathController;
    @end

    @implementation ViewController

    - (void)viewDidLoad
    {
        [super viewDidLoad];
        self.indexPathController = [[TLIndexPathController alloc] init];
    }

    #pragma mark - UITableViewDataSource

    - (NSInteger)numberOfSectionsInTableView:(UITableView *)tableView
    {
        return self.indexPathController.dataModel.numberOfSections;
    }

    - (NSInteger)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView numberOfRowsInSection:(NSInteger)section
    {
        return [self.indexPathController.dataModel numberOfRowsInSection:section];
    }

    - (UITableViewCell *)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView cellForRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath
    {
        UITableViewCell *cell = [tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier:@"Cell"];
        id item = [self.indexPathController.dataModel itemAtIndexPath:indexPath];
        //configure cell using data item
        return cell;
    }

    #pragma mark - TLIndexPathControllerDelegate

    - (void)controller:(TLIndexPathController *)controller didUpdateDataModel:(TLIndexPathUpdates *)updates
    {
        [updates performBatchUpdatesOnTableView:self.tableView withRowAnimation:UITableViewRowAnimationFade];
    }

    @end
 
 This template works with plain arrays or `NSFetchRequests`. With plain arrays, you
 simply set the `dataModel` property of the controller (or set the `items` property
 and get a default data model). With `NSFetchRequests`, you set the `fetchRequest`
 property and call `performFetch:`. From then on, the controller updates the data
 model interinally every time the fetch results change (using an internal instance
 of `NSFetchedResultsController` and responding to `controllerDidChangeContent` messages).
 
 In either case, whether you explicitly set a data model or the controller converts
 a fetch result into a data model, the controller creates the `TLIndexPathUpdates`
 object for you and passes it to the delegate, giving you an opportunity to perform batch updates:
 
    - (void)controller:(TLIndexPathController *)controller didUpdateDataModel:(TLIndexPathUpdates *)updates
    {
        [updates performBatchUpdatesOnTableView:self.tableView withRowAnimation:UITableViewRowAnimationFade];
    }
