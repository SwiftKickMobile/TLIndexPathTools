 A subclass of `UICollectionViewController` that works with `TLIndexPathController`

 This class also supports view controller-backed cells.

 The collection view's index path controller. A default controller is
 created automatically with `nil` for `identifierKeyPath`, `sectionNameKeyPath`.
 It is not uncommon to replace this default instance with a custom 
 controller. For example, if Core Data is being used, one would
 typically provide a controller created with the
 `initWithFetchRequest:managedObjectContext:sectionNameKeyPath:identifierKeyPath:cacheName:`
 initializer.

 The implementation of `collectionView:cellForItemAtIndexPath:` calls this method
 to ask for the cell's identifier before attempting to dequeue a cell. The default
 implementation of this method first asks the data model for an identifier and,
 if none is provided, returns the "Cell". Data models that don't use
 `TLIndexPathItem` as their item type typically return `nil` and so it is not
 uncommon to override this method with custom logic.

 call the super implementation to get the unconfigured cell or or create/dequeue
 the cell directly.

 This method should be overridden to enable view controller-backed cells. The default
 implementation returns `nil`. If this method returns a view controller for the given
 cell and index path, the table view controller will automatically install the backing
 controller as a child view controller in `cellForItemAtIndexPath` and uninstall it
 in `collectionView:didEndDisplayingCell:forItemAtIndexPath:`. This method is responsible
 for installing the view controller's view into the cell's view heirarchy.

 If set to NO, the view controller will not establish a containment relationship
 with view controllers instantiated for cells. This option exists because cases have
 been observed where the collection view can get in a bad state where cells fail
 to be removed from view as they move offscreen during an interactive transition.
 This seems to be a collection view bug and no workaround has been found. If you're
 not experiencing this issue, stick with the default value of YES to retain all of
 the normal view controller view containment behavior (view appearance calls,
 screen rotation calls, etc.).
